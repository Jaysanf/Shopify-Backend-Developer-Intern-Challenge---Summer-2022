# Shopify-Backend-Developer-Intern-Challenge---Summer-2022
## About this project
This is my take on **Shopify Backend Developer Intern 
Challenge - Summer 2022** 

which is : Build an inventory tracking web application 
for a logistics company. We are looking for a web application that meets the requirements
listed below, along with one additional feature, with the options also listed below. 
 
I've implemented CRUD and an export option:
1. Create inventory items
2. Edit Them
3. Delete Them
4. View a list of them
5. Push a button export product data to a CSV

I've coded in python and using the flask library to make the web application.
I am using some html templates i've used in the past for my project 
https://github.com/Jaysanf/Easy-Inventory I've done for the class CS50 Harvard.

I was kind of lucky in this year challenge because it was similar to what I've had
coded in the past for my personal project in CS50. I took this opportunity to look back 
at my code and implement the similar function of an inventory tracking web application but
using better techniques like OOP and using other files to make it easier for the addition of 
more features in the future. 
## Requirements
There is a folder for the requirements. You will also need Python3.8
you will need to have pip
